# News Summarization using the T5 model

This project utilizes the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model for news summarization. The T5 model, developed by Google Research, is a versatile transformer-based model capable of performing a wide range of text-based tasks, including summarization, translation, question answering, and more. 

## About T5 Model

T5 stands for "Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer," and it was introduced in the paper ["Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683). Unlike traditional models that are designed for specific tasks such as summarization or translation, T5 is trained in a text-to-text framework, where it is trained to map input text to output text in a unified manner. This makes T5 highly flexible and capable of adapting to various natural language processing tasks by simply framing the task as a text-to-text problem.

## Hugging Face Pipeline

In this project, the Hugging Face Transformers library is utilized to easily integrate the T5 model. Hugging Face provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for accessing pre-trained transformer models like T5 and deploying them for various NLP tasks. The pipeline provided by Hugging Face abstracts away the complexities of model loading, tokenization, and inference, allowing developers to quickly integrate state-of-the-art models into their projects with minimal effort.

## Dataset

The CNN/DailyMail dataset used in this project is available online. This dataset contains published news articles along with summaries written by humans. You can find more information about the dataset and access it [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZhongshengWang/Alpaca-cnn-dailymail).

## Repository Contents

- The Jupyter Notebook contains the code for utilizing the T5 model to summarize news articles.
- `t5_summary.csv`: CSV file containing the news articles for summarization.
